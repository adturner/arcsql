# Azure Arc for SQL
This is a repository that hosts a bunch of easy scripts that i haven't found elsewhere to help look at arc sql things.
+ Primary use case here is to pull all arc sql instances within the current subscription scope, display extension status/version and current license type
+ I included the root information on the host arc machine as well so you can find the specific thing you need to adjust/fix easily

# Tested On:
PowerShell 7.3.7 with PowerShell Az Module 10.4.1, PowerShell Az.ConnectedMachine 0.5.0
